# BBC sound effect downloader


This tool is intended for downloading sound effects from http://bbcsfx.acropolis.org.uk/. **The Sound Effects are BBC copyright, but they may be used for personal, educational or research purposes, as detailed in the license.** Please read the licensing information for these audio files before usage.


## Building from source
The easiest approach would be to download IntelliJ IDEA and import an existing gradle project.

## Just give me the files!
You must have Java installed on your machine. Download the latest release, run the executable within the bin folder.

**The executable can take up to two arguments:**

**No arguments** - The downloader runs through the whole archive

**One argument** (e.g. _sounddownloader 65_) - The downloader will start at page 65

**Two arguments** (e.g. _sounddownloader 40 80_) - The downloader will start at page 40 and stop when it reaches page 80
